#Merge attribute table with raster file in R
#Prior to this, I loaded the Bayarea Shape file in ArcMap, and rasterized at a 100m and 250m resolution
#By rasterizing the polygon at 100m resolution, this kept all 545 data lines from the ACS
#I was then able to export the raster at a resolution fo 250m and keep all the data
#the .vat.dbf is the attribute file exported from ArcMap along with the raster file, which I then put back into R
#the result is a raster file that has the attribute data in the dataframe

library(raster)
library(maptools)
library(rgeos)
library(rgdal)
library(foreign)# for loading DBF

setwd("C:/Users/Veronica Tinney/Dropbox/EDF_2019/baytif")

#Load raster
r <- raster('BayAreaFINAL250.tif')

#Load Data attribute file (DBF)
data <- read.dbf("BayAreaFINAL250.tif.vat.dbf")

#Create the attributes
ratify(r)

#rename DBF dataframe so it matches the first column of the raster attribtues
colnames(data)[1] <- "ID"

#set the levels on the raster equal to the dbf dataframe
levels(r) <- data

#the tif files were not maintaining the data, so I kept this as the grd format
writeRaster(r, filename="raster_rat.grd")

#read back in to verify
r2 <- raster("raster_rat.grd")
r2
